This is a startpage theme from: https://github.com/Nainish-Rai/aesthetic-startpage

I just want to badly use it for Firefox, but it looks like I'm forced to host through Github Pages with the New Tab Override plugin thing.

Also, tysm Nainish-Rai for making the startpage and to that one Redditor who showed this on r/unixporn lmao.
